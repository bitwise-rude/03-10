ea - NOP - Do nothing

10 - ADD A,B - Adds A and B and stores in A
11 - ADD A,C - Adds A and C and stores in A
12 - ADD A,D - Adds A and D and storees in A
13 - ADD A,E - Adds A and E and stores in A
14 - ADD A,F - Adds A and F and stores in A

20 - MOV A,B - Moves B's content to A
21 - MOV A,C - Moves C's content to A
22 - MOV A,D - Moves D's content to A
23 - MOV A,E - Moves E's content to A
24 - MOV A,F - Moves F's content to A

#- COMMENTS:
For registers operation, the 1 byte opcode can be divided in to two 
nibbles and the HI nibble will generally contain the instruction
and the lower nibble will contain the registers that the instruction
is being carried to. 

In case of Add, the opcode is 10, 10 in binary is 0001 0000, the 0001 is the opcode of
add and the last 0000 refers to A and B registers, this pattern is used everywhere
making many things easier.

For now, I have made that every instruction takes 1 machine cycle
This is not correct because for some instruction, the actual CPU might take longer
but later we have to use some kindof FPS to limit it and this actual 1 machine
thing will be true;
