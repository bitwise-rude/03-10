#- COMMENTS:
For registers operation, the 1 byte opcode can be divided in to two 
nibbles and the HI nibble will generally contain the instruction
and the lower nibble will contain the registers that the instruction
is being carried to. 

In case of Add, the opcode is 10, 10 in binary is 0001 0000, the 0001 is the opcode of
add and the last 0000 refers to A and B registers, this pattern is used everywhere
making many things easier.

For now, I have made that every instruction takes 1 machine cycle
This is not correct because for some instruction, the actual CPU might take longer
but later we have to use some kindof FPS to limit it and this actual 1 machine
thing will be true;

For memory operation like 25 MOV A,M <- M represents [memory address pointed by HL]

#- References:

Upper Nibbles reserved for the following
Add - > 0001
MOV - > 0010
SUB - > 0011
CMP - > 0100


1. Flags
Flag occpy the lower byte of AF register
the bit information for each bit in the F register is:
01234567
0 -> ZERO FLAG ( the previous operation resulted in accumulator to be zero)
1 -> CARRY FLAG ( the previous operation caused a carry, if in cmp, A is less than the argument)
